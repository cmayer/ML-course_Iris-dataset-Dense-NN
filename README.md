# Simple solution for Iris dataset classification problem neural network and fully connected layers.

The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 in his paper ["The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). The dataset contains 150 samples from three species of the Iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters). The goal is typically to classify the species based on these measurements.
