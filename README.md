# Simple solution for Iris dataset classification problem neural network and fully connected layers.

The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by the British statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 in his paper ["The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). The dataset contains 150 samples from three species of the Iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters). The goal is typically to classify the species based on these measurements.

Despite the fact that the dataset is rather small, it is possible for most reasonable train/test splits to achieve good classification results with a wide range of classifiers.

Here we use a neural network with one hidden layer to solve the classification problem with high prediction accuracies.
